# Project 3: Final Project
## Introduction

Using the skills we have learned throughout the Fall 2020 semester. We will bring together everything into one compile-able program.

## To run program

- Clone project
- After cloning, in projects first directory please run "make"
- Switch 1,3,4 will be activated by pressing down on a switch and de-activated by letting go
- Switch 2 will always be actively running and has no effect upon pressing(warning: may vary depending on MSP430) 
- To reset/erase screen please press resest button

## Switch 1

- pressing down on this switch will cause affirmations to appear and disappear while changing colors

## Switch 2

- this switch should be infinitely running, and cause a footer to be drawn at the bottom of the screen while changing colors. This switch will also call upon our red/green LED to dim while cpu turns off and awakes during interrupts.

## Switch 3

- pressing down will cause our LCD to draw circles in motion while giving the illusion of erasing anything in its path. This will also cause a siren buzzer to sound off while switch is down.


## Switch 4

- pressing down will make our LCD draw a stick robot, whose stomach is a diamond. The robot's diamond stomach should change colors while switch is down and also sound off another siren.
